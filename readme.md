# Portfolio Theme
A theme I designed and developed for my portfolio website.
Built with HTML, SCSS, JavaScript and a couple of libraries: Typewriter and AOS.

### About
This version has been edited to replace the original content with 'lorem ipsum' text.
Feel free to add your own information and use it as it is or tweak the design. 
You can add any number of projects and skills - the flexbox layout will adjust automatically.
It is also fully mobile responsive and adapts well to any device size.

### Development
Simply download the project and open it with your code editor of choice.
You will need Live Server and a Live SASS compiler to edit the theme in real time.
